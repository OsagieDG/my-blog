    <p><strong>Hi, I'm Osagie.</strong></p>

    <p>
    I'm just a guy who wants to build great software products, solo and/or with
    a team. I enjoy exploring my personal ideas as well as finding solutions to
    problems.
    </p>

    <p>
    I consider myself a Software Developer with 2 years of experience, having previously worked
    for a startup and now working on a personal project. However, I've never officially
    worked as a Software Developer for a traditional company.
    </p>

    <p>
    Outside of software development, I touch grass... hehe. I also enjoy hitting the
    gym, spending time with family and friends, as well as travelling.
    </p>

    All my posts reflect my perceptions and experiences.
    They are not intended as absolute truths.
