 <a href="https://arctivestudio.app">ARCtive Studio</a> enables you to overlay your workout
 metrics and route on your photos. I built it as a companion to Be ARCtive, but it
 works independently and doesn't require the Be ARCtive app to function.
 If you've recorded run or walk workouts connected to Apple Health using
 your Apple Watch or another app like Garmin Connect, you can use
 ARCtive Studio to compose workout overlays for your photos.
 </p>

 <h2>Why I Built This</h2>
  <p>
  I wanted to give users a way to visualize their workout metrics in a
  creative format they could share. Social media has become a place where
  people celebrate their fitness milestones, and I thought a dedicated tool for creating these
  visuals would be useful. The challenge was making something that felt intuitive and didn't
  overcomplicate the process. I wanted users to have creative control without feeling
  overwhelmed by options.
 </p>


  <h2>What You Can Do With It</h2>
  <p>
  The Overlay Composer is the heart of ARCtive Studio. You choose any photo as your
  background, then add one or multiple overlays showing your workout stats. You can drag,
  resize, and rotate overlays to position them exactly where you want. Change colors and
  opacity to match your aesthetic, and edit text on pure text overlays to create your
  perfect design.
 </p>

 <h2>What I Like Most About It</h2>
  <p>
   The flexibility of the Overlay Composer is what stands out to me.
   Being able to layer multiple overlays and customize each one individually
   gives users genuine creative freedom. I also appreciate how the clipboard
   feature integrates with apps people already use daily, like Instagram Stories.
   It removes friction from the sharing process.
  </p>

  <h2>To Conclude</h2>
  <p>
  Building this tool taught me a lot about balancing
  creative freedom with simplicity. The process of
  designing the Overlay Composer was similar to
  what I experienced with Be ARCtive's route map,
  challenging but rewarding. It's a small tool
  that does one thing well.
