    <p>
       <a href="https://bearctive.com">Be ARCtive</a> got updated again, but this time it is more focused.
      I decided to remove the targets feature because I want to focus more on the
      timer/route map feature, and I believe it no longer aligns with my plans for Be ARCtive.
      I honestly wasn't using it. For anyone who uses an Apple Watch, I'm sure you know
      about the Activity app. It is honestly amazing how good it is.
      This, and my decision to focus more on the timer/route map features,
      are the reasons why I decided to remove the target feature
      in the new update of Be ARCtive.
    </p>

    <h2>What's New in This Version</h2>
    <p>
      The latest update brings several improvements focused on enhancing the core workout tracking experience:
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Improved UI/UX for Phone and Watch Apps</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Consistent metric card display for route map on view and share</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Added ability to choose between Run/Walk workouts for Phone and Watch Apps</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Watch App now uses a stopwatch instead of a countdown timer</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">You can now choose your preferred unit (km or miles) for distance and pace</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What's Next?</h2>
    <p>
      The limitations of the apps I have built are that they are more client-side focused,
      and as someone who really enjoys building backends, I want to build some full-stack projects/products.
      However, I will continue to develop and maintain <a href="https://bearctive.com">Be ARCtive</a>
      and <a href="https://arctivestudio.app">ARCtive Studio</a> .
      Speaking of full-stack projects, remember Wreyte?
    </p>

    <h2>Progress on the Development of Wreyte (Writers' Platform)</h2>
    <p>
      I am still building Wreyte, although development has really slowed down over the past 5-6 months.
      Despite the slow progress, it's been going well. There were many times I thought about rewriting
      it due to the tech stack I chose, but I decided to stick with this method of developing the app
      as I believe it is sufficient despite the limitations, and my workflow
      with this current stack is honestly amazing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tech stack I am using for Wreyte is Go, Postgres, Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx,
      HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript with jsDoc, including type checking with ts-check.
      I chose this tech stack because it was what I knew at the time, although if I were to
      start a new project from scratch today, I would most likely use a framework.
      I hope to release the app this year, but there are no guarantees as
      I am now working on other projects and I do not want to rush
      the development of this app.

    <h2>Development Workflow Update</h2>
    <p>
      To conclude, my development workflow has changed since the last time I posted about it.
      Currently, I am using both Mac and Linux. Wreyte is and will continue to be built using
      my Linux PC, and everything to do with iOS development is obviously being done using my Mac.
      I managed to get my workflow on Mac to be similar to my Linux workflow,
      although it is still not as good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lately, I have been using Xcode more for iOS development as it is essential for
      certain aspects of the building, debugging, and deployment process.
      I still use the terminal for the majority of my development, and that will not change.
      I have just learned to adapt, and it's great having a tiling window manager on Mac just like Linux,
      as it allows me to switch from terminal to IDE pretty quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, that's it for now, and I hope to keep sharing more interesting updates in the future.
